# Medicine-Recommendation-system-using-ML

# Overview
This project aims to develop a Medicine Recommendation System that predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms and provides:

# description of the detected disease.
Recommended medicines.
Diet plans.
Workout suggestions.
Precautions to prevent further health issues.
This system uses machine learning algorithms for disease prediction and a user-friendly web application for interaction.

# Features
Disease prediction based on user input symptoms.
Medicine recommendations for the diagnosed disease.
Dietary suggestions for a healthier lifestyle.
Workout plans tailored to specific conditions.
Preventive measures and precautions.
# Technologies Used
Machine Learning Algorithms:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes

Web Application Development:
Backend Framework: Flask
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

# Accuracy
The implemented machine learning models achieved a 100% accuracy for disease prediction on the dataset.

# Project Architecture
Input Symptoms: Users input their symptoms through the web application.
Disease Prediction: The machine learning model predicts the disease based on the input.
Recommendations:
Medicines for the predicted disease.
Appropriate diet and workout suggestions.
Precautions for health management.
Frontend & Backend Integration: The system is built using Flask for backend processing and HTML/CSS/JS for the user interface.


# Datasets
The dataset contains details about symptoms and corresponding diseases,diet, medicine, workout and precautions. It was preprocessed and split into training and testing sets to build accurate machine learning models.

# Model Training
The following machine learning models were trained and tested:
Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Naive Bayes
The models were evaluated on accuracy, and the final selected model achieved 100% accuracy.

# Usage
Open the web application.
Enter your symptoms in the input fields.
Click "Submit" to predict the disease.
View the output, including:
Disease description.
Suggested medicines.
Dietary plans, workout routines, and precautions.







# Future Improvements
Expand the dataset to include more diseases and symptoms.
Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.
Implement a chatbot for interactive disease prediction.
Add multilingual support for wider accessibility.
